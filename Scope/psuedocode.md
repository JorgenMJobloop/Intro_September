# Plan for the "mock" banking app

# Classes
    - BankAccount.cs
        * SavingsAccount.cs
        * CheckingAccount.cs
    - Customer.cs

# We want to use polymorfism in our implementation
    to archieve this, we can make the "BankAccount" class abstract.
```cs
public abstract class BankAccount
{

}
```

# We want to encapsulate and have proper scoping in our implementation
```cs

```
